Hey! I'm Nathan, a Physics - Math double major at Berkeley. I'm interested in condensed matter physics, particle physics, and ML methods to make those things better. Take a look at my other repositories (PetProjects and Schoolwork) to see the code of a drunk cow. It *should* run fine on your machine though. I hope.
